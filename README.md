# Telengana-Weather-Analysis

### Project Objective
* Centralization: Build a single, interactive dashboard to consolidate and visualize key metrics (Rainfall, Temperature, Wind Speed, Humidity).
* Trend Analysis: Identify significant seasonal patterns, annual trends, and Year-over-Year (YoY) changes for each weather parameter.
* Geographical Comparison: Enable granular comparison of weather metrics between specific Districts and Mandals.

### Tools and Approach
* Tool : This entire project was built using Microsoft Power BI.
##### Process:
* Data Connection: Loaded the raw Telengana weather data based on 2021,2022,2023 and 2024.
* Data Modeling: Cleaned the data and created DAX measures to calculate KPIs like Total Days of Data, Average Max Temp, Average Wind Speed and Total Rainfall.
* Visualization: Designed this interactive dashboard with simple filters for Date, Seasons and Month.

### Conclusion
* The Telangana Weather Analysis project successfully established a centralized, interactive Power BI dashboard built upon four years (2021-2024) of daily weather data. 
* Visualization of the data clearly confirmed pronounced seasonal patterns. 
* The project transformed raw time-series data into actionable, comparative insights.
* External Data Integration: Integrate external datasets such as Crop Yield data or Health Records (e.g., heatstroke incidence) to analyze the direct impact of weather patterns on regional economic and health outcomes.



# How To Run the project
1). Download the dataset (My dataset is organisational based so refer datsets from websites like kaggle and data.com) <br>
2). Keep your dataset in the current working directory based on your power bi folder. <br>
3). Download the pbix file and drap and drop the column to work with the reports.
